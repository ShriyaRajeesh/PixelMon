## Q-Learning for Training the Pokemon Agent
The file 'Pixelmon_final.ipynb' file implements Q-learning using a Q-table to train an agent capable of playing optimally to defeat a real player in the game.
The agent uses self learning to learn using an opponent at a similar level. This allows a robust agent which can adapt to a new randoom opponent by training against 
stronger opponents the longer it trains.
